# KeepItBurning
final game project for 437
Basic concept for the game
- Keep your fire burning by collecting wood
- Kill minotaur to get food
- Have fun!

## Game engine
we made this game using the Godot game engine
I think that everyone in the group really enjoyed using godot 
The only problems we had while using godot was with version control. Some things just didn't get pushed to Git for some reason.
other than that it was a very easy and fun engine to use. I would recommend it to anyone.

### Video
We recorded a short video of us playing the game and discussing it's mechanics
